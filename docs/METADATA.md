# Metadata CSV Schema

## Overview
- Metadata is **optional** but recommended for improved profiling output.
- When provided via `--metadata` during indexing, its path is recorded inside the reference DB (`metadata/METADATA_SOURCE.txt`).
- During **profiling**, the metadata CSV is automatically loaded and matched with reference genomes to enrich the output with additional context (species, strain, assembly IDs, etc.).

## Is Metadata Required?
- No. The pipeline runs without a metadata CSV.
- However, if you want rich contextual information in your profiling results (e.g., species names, strain IDs), providing metadata is highly recommended.

## Current Behavior

### During Indexing (`strainvector index`)
- The `--metadata` flag accepts a path to a CSV file
- The path is stored in `refdb/metadata/METADATA_SOURCE.txt` for later use
- The CSV contents are NOT validated or used during indexing
- Embedding and vector storage proceed regardless of metadata

### During Profiling (`strainvector profile`)
- The profiling module automatically loads the metadata CSV (if it was provided during indexing)
- Matches metadata rows to reference genomes using the `file` column (matched by basename)
- Adds entire metadata row to each candidate in `results.json` under a `"metadata"` field
- If metadata CSV is missing or cannot be loaded, profiling continues without it (graceful degradation)

## Required and Recommended CSV Schema

### Required Column (for profiling to work)
- **`file`** (path, **REQUIRED**): Path to the genome FASTA file. The **basename** of this path (e.g., `E_coli_K12.fasta`) is used to match metadata with reference database entries during profiling. Without this column, metadata cannot be attached to profiling results.

### Recommended Columns (for rich output)
These columns will appear in your profiling output and help interpret results:

- `assembly_id` (string): Accession or unique ID (e.g., `GCF_000005845.2`).
- `species` (string): Species name (e.g., `Escherichia coli`).
- `strain` (string): Strain identifier (e.g., `K-12 substr. MG1655`).
- `source` (string): Source dataset or provenance (e.g., `UHGG`, `RefSeq`, `custom`).
- `genome_length` (int): Assembly length in base pairs.
- `gc_content` (float): GC percentage (0â€“100).
- `n50` (int): Assembly N50 metric.

### Additional Columns
- Extra columns are allowed and will be preserved in profiling output
- All columns from the metadata CSV are included in the `"metadata"` field of `results.json`

### Format Notes:
- Use comma-separated values (CSV) with a header row
- For paths in `file`, use filenames that match your input FASTA files (e.g., `examples/genomes/E_coli_K12.fasta`)
- The profiling module matches by basename, so `/path/to/E_coli.fasta` matches any reference with `source_basename: "E_coli.fasta"`

## Example Metadata CSV

```csv
assembly_id,species,strain,source,file
GCF_000005845.2,Escherichia coli,K-12 substr. MG1655,RefSeq,examples/genomes/E_coli_K12.fasta
GCF_000009645.1,Staphylococcus aureus,N315,RefSeq,examples/genomes/S_aureus_N315.fasta
GCA_001234567.1,Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron,VPI-5482,UHGG,examples/genomes/B_theta.fasta
```

## Example Profile Output

When metadata is provided, your `results.json` will include enriched candidate information:

```json
{
  "candidates": [
    {
      "id": "E_coli_K12.fasta",
      "count": 142,
      "mean_similarity": 0.956,
      "max_similarity": 0.982,
      "hybrid_score": 135.752,
      "metadata": {
        "assembly_id": "GCF_000005845.2",
        "species": "Escherichia coli",
        "strain": "K-12 substr. MG1655",
        "source": "RefSeq",
        "file": "examples/genomes/E_coli_K12.fasta"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Without metadata, the output would only include `id`, `count`, `mean_similarity`, `max_similarity`, and `hybrid_score`.

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements to metadata handling:
- Validation of required columns during indexing
- Support for alternative join keys besides `file` basename (e.g., `assembly_id`)
- Integration of metadata into per-vector JSONL manifests for advanced filtering
- Metadata-based result filtering in profiling (e.g., `--filter-species "Escherichia coli"`)
